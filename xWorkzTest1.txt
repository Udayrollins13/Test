1. 1).public Static void main(String args[])
  Ans:here, 
      public is a Access specifier
      Static is a Non-access specifier
      void is return_type 
      main is method_Name
      String args[] is parameters

   2).void
  Ans:void is a keyword and return_type,used to execute 
      the java program without any return_type values.

  3).static 
  Ans:static is a keyword and non-access specifier used 
      the write the static methods, declare and initialize 
      all type of variables.
 
  4).final 
 Ans:final is a keyword and non-access specifier used to 
     declare or store the constant 
     values  
   
  5).public 
 Ans:public is a keyword and Access specifier used to 
     declare the all classes methods. And every programmer can be access.

2. Explain data types briefly
   Data types is a fundamental concept of java programming language it means
   which type of data can be stored to the variable.

   Classification of Data types:
   In data types there are two types they are, 
   a).Primitive Data types.
   b).Non-primitive Data types.

a).Primitive Data types
   Primitive Data types are pre-defined datatypes or in-built functions.
   In Primitive Data types there are 8 types they are,
   i.int
  ii.float
 iii.double
  iv.long
   v.short
  vi.boolean
 vii.byte
viii.char     

b).Non-Primitive Data types
   Non-Primitive Data types are post-defined datatypes
   In Non-Primitive data types there are 4 types they are,
   i.String
  ii.class
 iii.array
  iv.Another one is not discussed

3.Explain variable and it's types
Ans:Variables is a container used to store the values with the help of data types.
    
    Types of variables 
    There are 4 types of varibles they are,
    i.Local variables.
   ii.Static variables.
  iii.Non-Static/Instance variables.
   iv.Parameterized variables.
   
 i.Local Variables 
   a).Local variables are must be declare and initialise in Class and methods.
   b).It should not declare out of the class or method.
   c).It sould not start with capitals and Numbers.
   d).It should not start with any special Characters except '$' and '_' .

   Syntax: Datatype Variable_Name;
 
   declaration and Initialization: int number; || int number = 5;

 ii.Static variables
   a).static variables are must be declare in Class and outside the methods.
   b).It should not declare out-side the class or in-side the method.
   c).It should not start with capitals and Numbers.
   d).It should not start with any special Characters except '$' and '_' .

    Syntax: Access specifier Non-Acces specifier Datatype Variable_Name;
 
   declaration: public static int number;

 iii.Non-Static varibles
    a).Non-static variables are must be declare in Class and outside the methods.
    b).It should not declare out-side the class or in-side the method.
    c).It should not start with capitals and Numbers.
    d).It should not start with any special Characters except '$' and '_' .

    Syntax: Access specifier Datatype Variable_Name;
 
   declaration: public int number;

  iv.Parameterized Variables
   a).Non-static variables are must be declare in Class and outside the methods.
   b).It should not declare out-side the class or in-side the method.
   c).It should not start with capitals and Numbers.
   d).It should not start with any special Characters except '$' and '_' .

    Syntax: Access specifier Non-acces specifier return_type Metho_Name(Datatype variable_name)
  
   declaration: public static void main(int number)

4.Explain methods and it's types and ways of declaration
Ans: Methods is Block of statement it contain set of statement and perform Specific task
     
    Types of Method 
    i.Without return_type and without Argument
   ii.With return_type and without Argument
  iii.Without return_type and with Argument
   iv.With return_type and with Argument

i.Without return_type and without Argument
  It means the return_type does not return any value and no argument or parameter passed.
  
 Ex: public static void main()
     {
       Statements
     }

ii.With return_type and without Argument
  It means the return_type return the value and no argument or parameter are passed.
  
 Ex: public static int main()
     {
       Statements
     }
iii.Without return_type and with Argument
  It means the return_type does not return any value and argument or parameter are passed.
  
 Ex: public static void main(int number)
     {
       Statements
     }

iv.With return_type and with Argumet
  It means the return_type return the value and argument or parameter are passed.
  
 Ex: public static in main(int number)
     {
       Statements
     }

5.Explain instance creation with prigramming
Ans: Instance is real world entity. New keyword is used to declare the instace
    
Normal class

public class School
    {
     public int numberOfRooms;
     public float bellTime;
     public boolean isOpen;
     public School() 
    }

Tester class 

public class SchoolDriver
{
 public school()
{
 School School = new School();
 school.numberOfRooms = new school();
 school.bellTime = new school();
 school.isOpen = new school();
}
 System.out.println("Number of rooms in school:"+school.numberOfRooms);
 System.out.println("School bell timimgs:"+school.bellTime);
 System.out.println("Now School is Open:"+school.isOpen);
}

6.Write a programming to sum of all Numbers
Ans: 

public class sum
{

 public static void main(String args[])
 {
  public static int array[];
  for(int i=0;i<9;i++)
  {
    System.out.println("The sum of all numbers:"+array[i]);
  }

7. 
    
10.a).Declare class properly
   b).where is method instructions
   c).this is get person details method
11. What is identifier and identifier rules 
Ans: Itentifier is a unique naming of variables
    
Rules:
a).It should not start with capitals
b).It should not start with numbers
c).It should not start with any special character except $ and _
d).It should not Java keawords

12.What is constructor 
Ans: Constructor name same as class name used to create objects or instance

13.List the 30 keywords
1.int
2.float
3.double
4.long
5.char
6.short
7.byte
8.boolean
9.String
10.class
11.array
12.static
13.final
14.abstact
15.package
16.private
17.protected
18.default
19.final
20.void
21.const
22.goto
23.excepton
24.new
25.if
26.else
27.for
28.while
29.print
30.this

14.Explain the program execution flow?
Ans: First we have to on the system, write the java program and then it contains class,methods and blocks 
    After these save and execute the program
    javac is a compiler it converts source code into byte code 
    After the compilation we have to execute by java 
    java is convert the byte code into .class formats 
    execute the program and shudown

15.Explain the java components
   JDK[Java Development Kit/Tool]
   JRE[Java RunTime Environment]
   JVM[Java virtual Machine]
